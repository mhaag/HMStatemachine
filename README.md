# HMStatemachine
This is an universal statemachine for embedded systems

Special Thanks to the article "State Machine Design in C++" Dr.Dobbs Magazine: http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/state-machine-design-in-c/184401236

The first version of this HMStatemachine was in principle the same as in the drdobbs article.
This statemachine just shows a real automation scenario as used in industrial PLCs.
